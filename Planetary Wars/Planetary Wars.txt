Planetary Wars
Verse 1
A three way war that has never ceased, the stars as numerous as those deceased
prepare for battles the likes you¡¯ve never seen, gore from different species, it¡¯s so obscene 
Only the weak die in these times of peril, the wicked shall fall by the firing barrel
Chorus 
Space crusaders they strike again,
Starship engines ignition begin!
Cosmic warriors clashing forever,
peace is gone!

Verse 2
Launching the attack better watch your back
Alien invasion, universe in devastation 
It may seem unkind but those who don¡¯t mind
engage battle stations, embrace annihilation.
Setting off alarms, aliens call to arms,
Lasers flying around, there is no safe grounds
Firing photons, fire on commands
The earlier you learn, war hunger yearns!
Launching the attack better watch your back
Alien invasion, universe in devastation 
It may seem unkind but those who don¡¯t mind
engage battle stations, embrace annihilation!
Verse 2(half of it)
Launching the attack better watch your back
Alien invasion, universe in devastation 
It may seem unkind but those who don¡¯t mind
engage battle stations, embrace annihilation.
Setting off alarms, aliens call to arms,
Lasers flying around, there is no safe grounds
Firing photons, fire on commands
The earlier you learn, war hunger yearns!
