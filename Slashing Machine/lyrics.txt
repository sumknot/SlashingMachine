Dropped in a pit, nowhere to run!
It's only you, a man with no gun
In the distance a tunnel so dark
Illuminated by one small spark!

Metal scraping, no escaping!
Furious sounds, death abound
Running helplessly, you start to see
It cannot be! The Slashing Machine!

Lost in the sewers, nowhere to run!
There is no hope! Your time is done!
Metal clanging, blades clashing
Mechanical death, takes your last breath!
You!... Can't!...Run!, it's here! Sliced to bits!
You!... Can't!... Hide!, cold steel! Sliced to bits!
You!... Will!... Meet!, your death! Sliced to bits!

Flaming eyes, blades like a blender !
Automaton demon, it does not surrender!
Sharpened rotors, swinging razors! 
Evil weapons, barbed wire and lasers!

You!... Can't!...Run!, it's here! Sliced to bits!
You!... Can't!... Hide!, cold steel! Sliced to bits!
