Roadkiller!

Intro
riff
*Drums start*
1Driving to forget the pain, doesn¡¯t sate my demon tastes
1Hellfire from my burning rubber, death comes to one and another
1Deathbound one direction, in my headlights your reflection
1Slow down! Not an option, mangled bodies my intention
1My car, my blood and body, possessed by evil you can¡¯t stop me
1Redlights, a signal to go! My tires will eat you and your soul
1.5 I¡¯m possessed, it¡¯s happening again, here it comes! I¡¯ve tried to stop it!
1.5 sanity lost, it¡¯s happening again, here it comes! I¡¯ve tried to stop it!
1Driving to forget the pain, doesn¡¯t sate my demon tastes
1Hellfire from my burning rubber, death comes to one and another
1Deathbound one direction, in my headlights your reflection
1Slow down! Not an option, mangled bodies my intention
2 Satan takes the wheel! Or am I just that irresponsible?!
2 Damn, I¡¯m drunk again?! But it¡¯s the spirits this time I swear!
2 I¡¯m a laosiji, it¡¯s not my fault! But who can¡¯t see the blood on the asphalt?
2.5 Oh who cares, I¡¯ll keep driving through!
Break

1Driving to forget the pain, doesn¡¯t sate my demon tastes
1Hellfire from my burning rubber, death comes to one and another

2 Satan takes the wheel! Or am I just that irresponsible?!
2 Damn I¡¯m drunk again?! But it¡¯s the spirits this time I swear!
2 I¡¯m a laosiji, it¡¯s really not my fault! But who can¡¯t see the blood on the asphalt?
2.5 Oh who cares, I¡¯ll keep driving through!
