Breaking your Limit
(Verse 1)
Becoming a prisoner, one self made
shackles are the things in your pocket
Hysteria and madness take control
Feeling like ripping your eyes out of socket 
Looking for easy ways out is your game
Money runs your life, you’re nothing without it
30 eyes watching you fail again
Looks like it’s time, you must rock it!
(chorus)
Fight! You must fight!
Rock! And kick ass! 
It’s all you got! Tonight! 
Train, harder! 
Test your might!
This time get it right!
Breaking your limit!
(verse 2)
loathing every minute, self-pity and hate
losing your energy and patience
looking deep inside, is there a way?
You now realize you got it!
(special chorus)
Trust yourself and no other
Take your chance, master your power!
(verse 3)
Pain becomes foundation, for your strength
looks like your not beaten
Self-will and supreme control
Ignore the cuts from their judgment
(chorus)
Fight! You must fight!
Rock! And kick ass! 
It’s all you got! Tonight! 
Train, harder! 
Test your might!
This time get it right!
Breaking your limit!
(verse 4)
Now a true warrior, one self made
no longer a slave of the corporate
Independent and strong willed
All of their words they eat it
(special chorus)
Trust yourself and no other
Take your chance, master your power!
(solo)
(verse 5)
Proven to yourself, no-one has compared
Disregard to all others
Hysteria and madness take control
Feeling like ripping their eyes out of socket
(special chorus)
Trust yourself and no other
Take your chance, master your power! 
Now you are the bigot you hated, 
look at your self, you will be never free!
